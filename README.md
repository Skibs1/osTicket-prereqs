To install PHP you copy this "PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi" and paste it into a google doc, and it should show a couple of results, the one you want to click on is the one underneath Microsoft. From there you can download PHP's content.

We are going to install MySQL and set up a username and password. as you can see in the photo above MYSQL is downloaded. to download MYSQL we are going to use the link "https//MySQL 5.5.62" it's going to be a typical installation. once installed you're going to launch a configuration wizard. then you are going to make up a username and password. make sure you remember it.

once everything is installed it will show you that osTicket has been installed and it will congradulate you. from there you will be able to browse to the login page

there are more things to download, but it would be easier if you were to YouTube: "How To Install osTicket with Prerequisites". and make sure it has the same orange kangaroo, and OsTicket before clicking on the video.
